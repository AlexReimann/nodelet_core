/**
 * \brief Internal use
 *
 * Manages a set of callback queues, potentially calling callbacks from them concurrently in
 * different threads.  Essentially a task manager specialized for callback queues.
 *
 * Uses 1 manager thread + N worker threads.  The manager thread gives work to the worker threads by
 * finding the thread with the fewest pending tasks and appending to that list.  This does mean that a
 * single long-running callback can potentially block other callbacks from being executed.  Some kind of
 * work-stealing could mitigate this, and is a good direction for future work.
